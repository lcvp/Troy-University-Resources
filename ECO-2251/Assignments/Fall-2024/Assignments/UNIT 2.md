What is the per-capita real GDP projected to be in 2023 and 2024? Compute the forecast rate of change in real GDP and per capita real GDP between 2023 and 2024.

**Problem 4:**

Gorgonzola is a small island nation with a simple economy that produces only six goods: sugar cane, yo-yos, rum, peanuts, harmonicas, and peanut butter. Assume that one quarter of all the sugar cane is used to produce rum and one half of all the peanuts are used to produce peanut butter.

a. Use the production and price information in the table to calculate nominal GDP for 20X3.  
b. Use the production and price information in the table to calculate real GDP for 20X1, 20X2 and 20X3 using 20X1 as the base year. What is the growth rate of real GDP from 20X1 to 20X2 and from 20X2 to 20X3?  
c. Use the production and price information in the table to calculate real GDP for 20X1, 20X2, and 20X3 using 20X2 as the base year. What is the growth rate of real GDP from 20X1 to 20X2 and from 20X2 to 20X3?  

| | **20X1** | | **20X2** | | **20X3** | |

**Problem 5:**

The following table contains nominal and real GDP data, in billions of dollars, from the General Statistics for 2021 and 2022. The data is listed per quarter, and the real GDP data was calculated using 2020 as the base year. Fill in the columns for the GDP deflator and for the percent increase in price level.

| | Nominal GDP | Real GDP | GDP Deflator | Percent Increase in Price Level |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

**Problem 6:**

Consider an economy that produces and consumes hot dogs and hamburgers. In the following table are data for two different years.

| | **2010** | | **2015** | |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Good** | **Quantity** | **Price** | **Quantity** | **Price** |
| Hot dogs | 200 | $2 | 250 | $4 |
| Hamburgers | 200 | $3 | 500 | $4 |


a. Using 2010 as the base year, compute the following statistics for each year: nominal GDP, real GDP, the implicit price deflator for GDP, and a fixed-weight price index such as the CPI.  
b. By what percentage did prices rise between 2010 and 2015? Give the answer for each good and also for the two measures of the overall price level. Compare the answers given by the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes. Explain the difference.  

**Problem 7:**

A country tracks inflation using a simple basket of two goods: Rice (kg) and Milk (liter). The table below shows the price per unit of each good over three years.

| Year | Price of Rice (per kg) | Price of Milk (per liter) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2021 | $2.50 | $3.00 |
| 2022 | $2.75 | $3.20 |
| 2023 | $3.10 | $3.50 |

A household typically buys 100 kg of rice and 50 liters of milk each year. Assume 2021 as the base year.

a. Compute CPI for each year?  
b. Compute the inflation rate for 2022 and 2023?  
c. Find the average annual inflation rate from 2021 to 2023?  
d. If the average wage in 2021 was $10,000 and increased to $11,000 in 2023, did wages keep up with inflation?  

**Problem 8:**

An economy has 100 people divided among the following groups: 25 have full-time jobs, 20 have one part-time job, 5 have two part-time jobs, 10 would like to work and are looking for jobs, 10 would like to work but are so discouraged they have given up looking, 10 are running their own businesses, 10 are retired (assuming they are capable of working), and 10 are small children.

a. Calculate the labor force and the labor-force participation rate.  
b. Calculate the number of unemployed and the unemployment rate.
