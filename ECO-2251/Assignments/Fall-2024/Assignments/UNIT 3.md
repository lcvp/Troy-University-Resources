**Problem 1:**

Suppose that in the year 2024, ABC company planned to produce 500,000 units of its lightweight scuba tanks. Of the 500,000 it planned to produce, a total of 50,000 units would be added to the inventory at its new plant in Hai Phong. Also assume that these units have been selling at a price of $250 each and that the price has been constant over time. Suppose further that this year the firm built a new plant for $20 million and acquired $5 million worth of equipment. It had no other investment projects, and to avoid complications, assume no depreciation.
Now suppose that at the end of the year, ABC had produced 500,000 units but had only sold 400,000 units and that inventories now contained 100,000 units more than they had at the beginning of the year. At $250 each, that means that the firm added $25,000,000 in new inventory.

a. How much did ABC company actually invest this year?  
b. How much did it plan to invest?  
c. Would ABC produce more or fewer units next year? Why?  

**Problem 2:**

You are given the following data concerning TopOne , a country located in the mountains.  
(1) Consumption function: $C = 150 + 0.7Y$; (2) Investment function: $I = 75$; (3) $AE = C + I$; (4) $AE = Y$.

a. What is the marginal propensity to consume in TopOne, and what is the marginal propensity to save?  
b. Graph equations (1) to (4) and solve for equilibrium income.  
c. Suppose equation (2) is changed to (2’) $I = 90$. What is the new equilibrium level of income? By how much does the 15-currency unit increase in planned investment change equilibrium income? What is the value of the multiplier?  
d. Calculate the saving function for TopOne. Plot this saving function on a graph with equation (2). Explain why the equilibrium income in this graph must be the same as in part b.  

**Problem 3:**

Use the graph to answer the questions that follow.  
a. What is the value of the MPC?  
b. What is the value of the MPS?  
c. What is the value of the multiplier?  
d. What is the amount of unplanned investment at aggregate outputs of 300, 900, and 1,300?  

**Problem 4:**

This unit argues that saving and spending behavior depend in part on wealth (accumulated savings and inheritance), but our simple model does not incorporate this effect. Consider the following model of a simple economy:

$C = 50 + 0.8Y + 0.1W$; $I = 200$; $W = 500$; $Y = C + I$; $S = Y - C$

a. If you assume that wealth (W) and investment (I) remain constant (we are ignoring the fact that saving adds to the stock of wealth), what are the equilibrium levels of GDP (Y), consumption (C), and saving (S)?  
b. Now suppose that wealth increases by 100 percent to 1,000. Recalculate the equilibrium levels of Y, C, and S. What impact does wealth accumulation have on GDP?  

**Problem 5:**

According to OECD data, in 2015, household saving as a fraction of disposable income in Germany was 10.1 percent, while in Brazil it was 14.2 percent. All else equal, what does this difference tell us about the MPC, MPS, and multipliers of the two economies? How would an increase in investment of the same amount impact the aggregate output in each economy?
