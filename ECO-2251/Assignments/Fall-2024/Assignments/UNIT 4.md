**Problem 1:**

For the data in the following table, the consumption function is C = 800 + 0.6(Y – T). Fill in the columns in the table and identify the equilibrium output.

| Output | Net Taxes | Disposable Income | Consumption Spending | Saving | Planned Investment Spending | Government Purchases | Planned Aggregate Expenditure | Unplanned Inventory Change |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2,100 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 2,600 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 3,100 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 3,600 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 4,100 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 4,600 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |
| 5,100 | 100 | | | | 300 | 400 | | |


**Problem 2:**

Assume the following for the economy of a country:

Consumption function: $C = 50 + 0.8Yd$  
Investment: $I = 80$  
Government spending: $G = 50$  
Disposable income: $Yd = Y - T$  
Net taxes: $T = 50$  
Equilibrium: $Y = C + I + G$  
a. Solve for equilibrium income.  
b. What happens to the economy when the marginal propensity to save increases to 0.3?  
c. How much does equilibrium output change if government purchase increases to 100?  

**Problem 3:**

Complete the following:

a. If the tax multiplier is -1, then the marginal propensity to save is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the marginal propensity to consume.  
b. If the government spending multiplier is 8, then the marginal propensity to save equals \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
c. If the marginal propensity to consume is two times the marginal propensity to save, then the government spending multiplier equals \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
d. If the marginal propensity to save is 0.5, then the tax multiplier equals \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
e. If the marginal propensity to save increases by 10 percent, then the government spending multiplier \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
f. If the marginal propensity to consume goes from 0.8 to 0.85, then the tax multiplier \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
g. If the tax multiplier increases (in absolute value) from -1 to -2, this means that the marginal propensity to consume has \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ relative to the marginal propensity to save.  
h. If the government spending multiplier decreases from 5 to 4, this means that the marginal propensity to save has \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  

**Problem 4:**

The data of goods market in an open economy as follows:  
Consumption function: $C = 250 + 0.6 (Y – T)$  
Investment function: $I = 300$  
Government Spending: $G = 250;$  
Net tax function $(= To + tY)$: $T = 40 + 0,1Y$  
$AE = C + I + G$  

a. Construct the planned aggregate expenditure function and find the equilibrium output/income?  
b. Calculate the government budget level (B) at the equilibrium output?  
c. How much government spending should be changed ($\Delta G$) if national income increased to 1,800?  
d. Compute the tax rate ($t$) at which government budget is balanced ($B = 0$) and goods market obtained equilibrium output ($Y = AE$)?
