**Presentation Guidelines**

- Each group has only **20 minutes** for the presentation;
- The number of slides prepared should be 20 (main slides);
- Each group needs to focus on main contents and assign members to participate in the presentation in a unified and organically linked manner, avoiding mechanical compilation;
- Slides must be completed before the presentation schedule; That is, before 11:59 PM on May 12th for groups presenting on May 13th, and before 11:59 PM on May 19th for groups presenting on May 20th, 2025.
- Your slides should be uploaded to the "Report Slides" folder, located under the "Files" tab on the "Group project" channel.
- Listening groups will be assigned raising questions to the presenting group for discussion.
- The presentations’ schedule will be found on the MS Teams channel.
