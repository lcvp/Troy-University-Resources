Mr. Nam is a middle manager at TechGrow Solutions, an expanding software company. Recently promoted to oversee the Customer Support Department, he is now responsible for 16 employees, more than double the team size he used to supervise in his previous role. Although Mr. Nam is technically competent and has a strong understanding of customer service protocols, he now struggles with managing such a large team. Some employees report delays in getting his feedback or decisions, while others feel unclear about their individual roles within the department. Communication is becoming inefficient, and team performance is starting to decline.

Mr. Nam realizes that his old management style, personally reviewing each case and decision is no longer effective with a broader span of control. He is unsure how to delegate better and structure the team so that performance and motivation remain high. At the same time, upper management expects quick improvements, as customer satisfaction is one of the company's strategic priorities this quarter.

**_Question 1.1._ What management skills does Mr. Nam need to improve to handle this situation effectively? Support your answer with evidence from the case.**

**_Question 1.2._ How can Mr. Nam adjust his leadership style to better manage a larger span of control? Suggest at least two specific actions or strategies he can implement.**
