Ms. Linh is the team leader of the customer service department at a medium-sized company. Recently, she has noticed that her team members have shown signs of reduced motivation: they are less enthusiastic, often late for work, and the quality of customer interactions has noticeably declined. Despite making efforts to encourage and support the team, such as sharing shifts fairly, recognizing individual contributions, and trying to build a more positive work environment, Ms. Linh feels that the overall atmosphere remains tense and uninspired.

The company's budget is tight, and Linh does not have the authority to increase salaries or offer financial bonuses. However, she still wants to find ways to motivate her team and boost their morale. Meanwhile, the company's upper management has also noticed the decline in performance and is considering solutions to improve the team's productivity and job satisfaction.

**_Question 2.1._ What should Linh do to motivate her team, given her current level of authority?**

**_Question 2.2._ If Linh were an upper-level manager, which leadership styles should she adopt to improve the motivation and morale of the customer service team?**
