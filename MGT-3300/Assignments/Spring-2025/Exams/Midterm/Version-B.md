**Story of Tesla Management**

</div>

In 2011, Tesla declared its goal to become the "most appealing car company of the 21st century" and accelerate the world's transition to electric cars. At that time, this seemed somewhat idealistic. Tesla has revealed plans to expand its factory in Germany, aiming to double its capacity to 1 million cars per year.

To continue its breakthrough, every business needs to set superior principles. Based on this perspective, Tesla applied the principle of "No Silo" to its brand. "No Silo" means no isolation. "Silo" describes the isolation that occurs when employees or entire departments in an organization do not want or do not have the means to share information or knowledge with each other. To become smarter and more agile than competing counterparts, Musk emphasized that Tesla must address a weakness that companies, when developing to a certain scale, often encounter: internal differentiation or "Silo."

Tesla had to resist the trend of internal differentiation. Musk said he would fire any manager at Tesla who let this happen, let alone encourage or coerce subordinates to report to him first. This means, "you can talk directly to a vice president in another department, you can talk to anyone without needing anyone else's permission. Moreover, you should consider it your duty to do so until the right thing happens." ... "We are all on the same boat. So, always remind yourself that you are working for the benefit of the company, not for the selfish interests of the department you are working for," Musk wrote.

**_Questions:_**  
The "No Silo" principle applied at Tesla is based on which principle according to Henri Fayol's 14 Principles of Management?
