* **A.** Isolated, open, closed  
* **B.** Closed, open, isolated  
* **C.** Open, isolated, closed  
* **D.** Isolated, closed, open  

**Question 3:** A reaction under certain conditions has an enthalpy change of $\Delta H = -118 \text{ kJ}$. This means that $118 \text{ kJ}$ of heat would be liberated  
* **A.** if the reaction were carried out at constant pressure.  
* **B.** if the reaction were carried out at constant concentrations.  
* **C.** no matter how the reaction were carried out.  
* **D.** if the reaction were carried out at constant volume.  

**Question 4:** A gas at $25.00^\circ\text{C}$ and $0.47 \text{ atm}$ expands from $25.0 \text{ L}$ to $35.0 \text{ L}$. What is the value of the work done on or by the gas? ($1 \text{ L}\cdot\text{atm} = 101.325 \text{ J}$)
* **A.** $480 \text{ J}$
* **B.** $3600 \text{ J}$
* **C.** $-3600 \text{ J}$
* **D.** $-480 \text{ J}$

### Part II. (2 points) Long answer question

**Question 5:** When fuel is burned in a cylinder equipped with a piston, the volume expands from $0.255 \text{ L}$ to $1.45 \text{ L}$ against an external pressure of $1.02 \text{ atm}$. In addition, $875 \text{ J}$ is emitted as heat. What is the $\Delta E$? ($101.3 \text{ J} = 1 \text{ L}\cdot\text{atm}$)
