**Question 1 (2 points):** A student thought that the mass of carbon must be 12 amu because he believed that carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. However, he found on a periodic table of the elements that the mass of carbon is 12.011 amu. Why does this difference happen?

**Question 2 (8 points):** When hydrogen sulfide gas is bubbled into a solution of sodium hydroxide, the reaction forms sodium sulfide and water. How many grams of sodium sulfide are formed if 3.00 g of hydrogen sulfide is bubbled into a solution containing 10.00 g of sodium hydroxide, assuming that the sodium sulfide is made in 97.5% yield?
