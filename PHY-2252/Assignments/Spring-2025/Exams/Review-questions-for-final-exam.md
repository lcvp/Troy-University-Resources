**Part 1. Mechanics**

**1.** Acceleration vector in a curve motion: definition, decomposition of the acceleration vector into two components (tangential and normal), the magnitude, the direction and the physical meaning of each component.

**2.** The definition of (translational) momentum for a point mass and a system of point masses. Derivation of the law of momentum conservation for an isolated system. An example of application of the law. The impulse-momentum theorem. The meaning of the concept of impulse.

**3.** The relations between force and potential energy. The equations that relate force and energy for the gravitational force (near and far from the Earth surface).

**4.** Center of mass. Motion of a system of particles. Collision in the center-mass frame of reference. Collisions, elastic and inelastic, radial and non-radial. Radial absolutely elastic and absolutely inelastic collisions.

**5.** Moment of inertia for systems of discrete point masses and for a continuous distribution of masses. The parallel-axis theorem (including its derivation).

**6.** Torque of a force acting on a rotational rigid body (the definition, the components of the torque vector and their physical meaning). Derivation of the fundamental equation for the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis.

**7.** Angular momentum for a material point and for a rigid body about a fixed axis. The theorem of angular momentum and the law of conservation of angular momentum.

**Part 2. Thermo physics and thermodynamics**

**8.** State the content of molecular kinetic theory, the equation of the relationship between temperature and pressure.

**9.** Definition internal energy of thermodynamic system. Statement, expression, consequence, meaning of the first law of thermodynamics. Apply the first law to examine the equilibrium processes of ideal gas.

**10.** State the second law of heat transfer and the second kind of perpetual motion machine (statements of Clausius and Thomsons). Prove that these two statements are equivalent.

**11.** Describe the Carnot cycle. Calculate the efficiency of a Carnot engine. State the Carnot theorem.

**12.** State the definition, properties, and significance of entropy. State the principle of increasing entropy. Entropy and the second law (give the quantitative expression of the second law). The formula for entropy change for an ideal gas.
