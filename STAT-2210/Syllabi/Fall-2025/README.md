### COURSE DESCRIPTION
The aim of this course is to understand randomness, uncertainty, and applications of statistical techniques, such as experimental design, hypothesis testing, parametric and non-parametric tests along with descriptive statistics in contemporary research.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course will cover:
1. Basic concepts such as random experiments, probability rules and counting methods.
2. Single and multiple random variables (discrete, continuous, and mixed), their distributions as well as moment-generating functions.
3. Limit theorems and convergence.
4. Introduction to mathematical statistics.
5. Parameter estimation, Hypothesis testing and Linear regression.
6. Random processes including processing of random signals, Poisson processes.
7. Simulation using EXCEL/MegaStat and R.
8. Learn methods of building statistical models.
