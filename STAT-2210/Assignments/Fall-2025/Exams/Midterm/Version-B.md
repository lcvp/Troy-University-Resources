### III. Constructed response questions. Answer the questions completely and clearly.

**Question 13.** A local fire station receives on average $\lambda$ rescue telephone calls per day. Assume that the number of these calls in a day has a Poisson distribution. The probability that the local fire station receives at least one rescue telephone call in a day is $0.527633$. Find the parameter $\lambda$ and the probability that the local fire station will receive fewer than three rescue telephone calls over the next four days.

**Question 14.** The duration of a telephone call in minutes can be modeled as a continuous random variable $T$ with PDF $f_T(t) = \frac{1}{144}(36 - t^2)$ if $t \in [0, 6]$, and $f_T(t) = 0$ if $t \notin [0, 6]$. The phone company charges 10000 VND per minute for telephone calls. What is the expected revenue per call for the phone company?

**Question 15.** The CDF of a continuous random variable $X$ is given by $F_X(x) = 1 - e^{-x}$ if $x \ge 0$, and $F_X(x) = 0$ if $x < 0$. Write the CDF $F_Y(y)$ of $Y = -4X + 6$.
