### II. Multiple choice questions (Students need to find ALL correct answers)

**Question 9.** Traffic engineers have coordinated the timing of two traffic lights to encourage a run of green lights. In particular, the timing was designed so that with probability 0.8 a driver will find the second light to have the same color as the first. Assuming the first light is equally likely to be red or green, what is the probability $P[G_2]$ that the second light is green? and what is $P[G_1|R_2]$, the conditional probability of a green first light given a red second light?

**Question 12.** In a certain factory, three machines $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$, make 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively, of the products. The factory's record shows that 2%, 4% and 6% of the products made by machines $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$, respectively, are defective. A finished product is selected at random from the factory. Consider two events: $A$="the selected product is defective", and $B_3$="the selected product is made by machine $M_3$". Which of the following statements are correct?

### III. Constructed response questions. Answer the questions completely and clearly.

**Question 13.** The duration of a telephone call in minutes can be modeled as a continuous random variable $T$ with PDF $f_T(t) = \frac{1}{486}(81 - t^2)$ if $t \in [0, 9]$, and $f_T(t) = 0$ if $t \notin [0, 9]$. The phone company charges 10000 VND per minute for telephone calls. What is the expected revenue per call for the phone company?

**Question 14.** The CDF of a continuous random variable $X$ is given by $F_X(x) = 1 - e^{-x}$ if $x \ge 0$, and $F_X(x) = 0$ if $x < 0$. Write the CDF $F_Y(y)$ of $Y = -3X + 5$.

**Question 15.** A local fire station receives on average $\lambda$ rescue telephone calls per day. Assume that the number of these calls in a day has a Poisson distribution. The probability that the local fire station receives at least one rescue telephone call in a day is $0.713495$. Find the parameter $\lambda$ and the probability that the local fire station will receive fewer than three rescue telephone calls over the next four days.
