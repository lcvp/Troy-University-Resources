### Aesthetics

**Aesthetics:** the branch of philosophy dealing with such notions as the beautiful, the ugly, the sublime, the comic, etc., as applicable to the fine arts, with a view to establishing the meaning and validity of critical judgments concerning works of art, and the principles underlying or justifying such judgments.

**Dennis Dutton and the 7 signatures of aesthetics.**  
1. **Expertise or virtuosity:** Technical artistic skills are cultivated, recognized, and admired.  
2. **Non-utilitarian pleasure:** People enjoy art for art's sake, and don't demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.  
3. **Style:** Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.  
4. **Criticism:** People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting work of art.  
5. **Imitation:** With a few important exceptions like music and abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.  
6. **Special focus:** Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.  
7. **Imagination:** Artists and their audiences entertain hypothetical worlds in the theater of the imagination.
