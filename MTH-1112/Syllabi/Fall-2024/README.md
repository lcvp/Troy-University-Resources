**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
Topics include the algebra of functions, including polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The course also contains systems of equations and inequalities, linear and quadratic equations and inequalities, graphs of polynomials, and the binomial theorem.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
At the conclusion of the course the students will be able to:
1. Understand the fundamental notions of functions, such as: domain and range, graph, 1-1 function, inverse function, piecewise defined function, etc.
2. Apply linear, quadratic, polynomial, and rational functions, such as: find demand/supply functions; find cost/revenue/profit functions; find maximum profit; etc.
3. Manipulate and evaluate exponential, logarithmic functions.
4. Graph algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
5. Apply the formulae for compound interest and continuous compound.
6. Solve exponential and logarithmic / growth and decay equation.
7. Solve system of linear equations using Gauss elimination method.
8. Solve system of linear inequalities and do problems on linear programming.
9. Evaluate binomial coefficient and apply binomial theorem to find binomial expansions.
