**Question 1.**  
a) A credit union pays interest of 10% per annum compounded monthly on a certain savings plan. If $10000 is deposited in such a plan and the interest is left to accumulate, how much is in the account after 2 years?  
b) Solve the following equation: $5^x \cdot 2^{\frac{2x-1}{x+1}} = 50$.  

**Question 2.**  
Given the following function $f(x) = \frac{3x+2}{x-1}$

b) Find the average rate of change of $f$ from $x_0$ to $x_0 + h$, where $h$ is real.  

**Question 3.**  
The area of the opening of a rectangular window is to be 143 square feet. If the length is to be 2 feet more than the width, what are the dimensions?  

**Question 4.**  
Solve the following system of linear equations  

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 1 \\
x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 = 2 \\
