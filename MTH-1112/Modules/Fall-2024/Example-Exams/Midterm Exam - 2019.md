**Question 1.**  
Consider the function

$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
3x + 2, & \text{if } x < -2,\\
-2x + 3, & \text{if } x \ge -2.
\end{cases}
$$

a. Graph the function  
b. List the intercepts

**Question 2.**  
Consider the function $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 2$,  
a. Determine whether function $f$ is even, odd or neither.  
b. Find the average rate of change of $f$ from $x_0$ to $x_0 + h$, where $h$ is real.  

**Question 3.**  
Given the function $f(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1$. Graph this quadratic function using the transformation.  

**Question 4.**  
Funfest Football Company has determined that the marginal cost C dollars of manufacturing x football clubs may be expressed by the quadratic function $C(x) = 5.3x^2 - 1081.2x + 56,100$  
a. How many clubs should be manufactured to minimize the marginal cost?  
b. At this level of production, what is the marginal cost?  

**Question 5.**  
a) Show that the following polynomial function has at least one zero in the given interval: $f(x) = 2x^4 - 3x^3 + 12x^2 - 7x - 1$ ; $[0; 1]$  
b) Find any horizontal, vertical, or oblique asymptotes of the following function  
$$f(x) = \frac{x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x - 5}{x^2 - 3x + 2}$$  

**Question 6.**  
Fourth-degree polynomial with real coefficients with zeros: $1, -2, 3 + 2i$. Find the remaining zero and write a polynomial meets the above conditions.  

**Question 7.**  
Find the inverse of each function and check your answer  
a) $f(x) = \frac{5x+2}{-4x+3}$  
b) $f(x) = 3 - \sqrt[3]{4x + 3}$  

**Question 8.**  
a) Write the following expression as the sum and/or difference of logarithms  
$$\log_5 \frac{3x^2 + 6x + 3}{\sqrt[5]{(x^2 + 1)^4}}, x > -1$$  
b) Given $\log_{12} 18 = a$; $\log_{24} 54 = b$. Prove that $ab + 5(a - b) = 1$  

**Question 9.**  
Solve the following equations  
a) $\log_2 (3x - 1) + \log_2 (10 - 2x) = 4$  
b) $(3 - 2\sqrt{2})^{x^2 - 4x} = (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^{6-x}$  

**Question 10.**  
a) If \$10,000 is invested at 8% compounded monthly, how much is there after 18 months?  
b) If you want to have \$12,000 in 15 months, how much do you need to place in a savings account now that pays 10% compounded quarterly.
